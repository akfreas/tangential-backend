ðŸ”´ Overall status of new application monitoring is  red. Milestone 1 on October 3rd is likely not going to be held due to predicted delays in the monitoring infra epic. We are currently discussing with Paul from Team Pretzel if we can mitigate this problem by removing one nice-to have feature from Team Pretzelâ€™s backlog.

Details: 
ðŸ”´ Red: Monitoring infra by team Pretzel. This is the last epic required for Milestone 1 and is planned to start on September 24th. The schedule will likely slip, as team Pretzel is still blocked with work on the Infra cost reduction program due to added features and bugs into the epic there. 

The other contributing epics are on track:
ðŸŸ¢ Green: Mobile monitoring by team Maverick. Work has finished on September 12th. 
ðŸŸ¢ Green: Service layer by team Stardust. Work is 83% ready and based on the past velocity of the team, all user stories will be finished on September 27th. 
ðŸŸ¢ Green: AuthN by team Maverick. Work is 81% ready and based on the past velocity of the team, all user stories will be finished on October 1st."
